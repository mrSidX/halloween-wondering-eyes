Arduino Controlled Halloween Wondering Eyes

Summary:
This code is part of a physical moving eye effect, crafted in a box.
Arduino controls servo... Which controls the eyes, randomly moving back and forth, 
like glowing eyes in the dark woods.  They are always looking around. Wary eyes.

This code is used in an Arduino Nano, that has a servo connected to it.
The servo swivels back and forth, at random.
That random motion controls a set of eyes within a box.
Those eyes are tied or harnessed in a way to control the eyes (back and forth) movement.


(My Specific Scenario): 
I have a box.
That box has eye cutouts centered in the front of the box.
I am using a soda can box... Or more specifically an empty (less wide) La Croix seltzer water box.
I used a particular shape, like spooky cat eyes, for the eyes.
I cut them out on that box, at a natural proportional distance, to make it look real.
I make a set of eyes, each created from the 2 pieces of box cutout, bridged (glued) together by either a piece of carboard from the same box, or otherwise.
That bridge is long enough to combine the 2 eye cutouts "pupils" or "cornea", that are centered within the middle of the cut out eyes on the box.  To make it look like real eyes.
The servo is glued to the inside of the box...
The eyes will be fitted with a piece of string of otherwise string or fishing line type of material that is capable of withstanding long back an forth frictional movents during operation.
That line is attatched the eyes, and through a point bracket loop (I use a cut piece of paperclip and make a hump in a straight piece, that will act as a loop).
Each bracket loop is positioned on the inside of the box, near the corner of each eye, and either glued or fastened somehow to provite a loop to string the thread through.
The servo will be positioned between the eyes inside the box, and will protrude enough to now crate a virtual triangle from the servos swiveling tip, to the two bracket loop points you just created.
The string ends attached to the eyes (and bridge) will tread through these bracket loops and attach to the servo.  
Hot glue maybe... 
But get the string relatively tight with enough slack to for the triangle shape...  Less slack the better, but a small amount maybe OK.
In theory the servo will do it's wary randoms, and control the string which pulls the eyes left and right.

You may need to adjust or tinker with the range values for your particular scaled boxes and eye cutouts.





Purpose / Effect: 
To give an "eyes in the dark" effect, for props and halloween type of decoration and or props.
